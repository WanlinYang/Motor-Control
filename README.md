# A DC-Motor Control Project

This is the final project of [ME333-Intro to Mechatronics](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/courses/descriptions/333-introduction-to-mechatronics.html).
The project aims to build a PID control system for a DC brush motor using an NU32 microcontroller.

The major hardware components for the project are listed below.

* the NU32 microcontroller board
* brushed DC motor with encoder
* decoder board
* current-sense amplifier board
* H-bridge
* a battery pack to provide power to H-bridge
* resistors and capacitors

The circuit connection could be found in [circuit_graph.pdf](circuit_graph.pdf).

If the circuit does not work, please check the circuit connection or switch pins of RS+ and RS- of
the Curret-sense Amplifier.
