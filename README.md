# A Motor Control Project

This is the final project of [ME333-Intro to Mechatronics](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/courses/descriptions/333-introduction-to-mechatronics.html).
The project aims to build a PID control system for a DC brush motor using an NU32 microcontroller.

The circuit connection could be found in [circuit_graph.pdf](circuit_graph.pdf)

If the circuit does not work, switching pins of RS+ and RS- of
the Curret-sense amplifier could be a possible solution.
